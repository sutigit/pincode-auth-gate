# pincode-auth-gate CLI

A simple Node.js CLI tool for managing app authorization pincodes via Supabase.

## Setup

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sutigit/pincode-auth-gate.git
cd pincode-auth-gate

# install dependencies

## Usage

Youâ€™ll be asked:

Create new pincode or change code in existing app? (c = create/e = existing): c
Enter name of the app in which the pincode will be used in: sample-app
| processing

app: sample-app
pin: 482917
id: 12
```
